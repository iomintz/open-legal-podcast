# Introductions

- How we got here
  * Briefly: Kyle background, Joel background 
  * Catalyst: Blue Oak Model License and Joel’s podcast episode on same

- Feedback from that episode: 
  * Ken Fallon at ~10:30 in HPR 2826: "I wonder what the OSI would have to say about this, because I think their general stance is ‘stop inventing licenses.’"
  * Is that the OSI position? Where might this idea have come from?
  * What might motivate the “stop inventing licenses” stance?
  * Why *shouldn't* we stop making more licenses?
  
- Thanks and wrap up!

## Post-roll

I’ll record this bit separately. This way it’s sort of split out from the flow of conversation, so if the contact info ever changes, we can replace it later.

- Get in touch: where to send questions
- (?) where to find more episodes
